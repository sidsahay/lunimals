### The Moonrock
Thag was quite annoyed. He had been inching across the forest behind the wild aurochs, and had been within hailing distance when suddenly there was a loud BANG from just across the mountain and moments later, a rather disorienting shaking of the ground. The sky near the mountain had lit up momentarily, and he could've sworn that the side of the mountain looked a trifle dented...and oh! there was smoke coming from the dent now. Definitely smoke. Whatever that caused the BANG was evidently rather hot. Thag fervently hoped that there wouldn't be a forest fire. They had barely escaped the last one. Thus reminded of his people, he broke his reverie and looked around for his prey. 

The aurochs had evidently shared his annoyance, because it was presently more than a hundred meters away and increasing that figure at a fair clip. It would be quite impossible for Thag, whose species was built for endurance running and not for competing with quadrupeds in maximum attainable speed, to catch him now. He sighed in annoyance and set off towards the mountain. Maybe, just maybe, the heat had killed something and he could take that back home.

Thag was a pretty fair representative of his species. A hairy, stocky build that was ideal for hunting and long marches through the cold, hands with opposable thumbs that could grip sticks (and other things) with an ease that would have given his ancestors quite the turn, and a low, but almost globular braincase within which slumbered the potential for world domination (not that Thag knew that). His people were nomadic hunter-gatherers, and had the distinction of being the first Earthly species to cross the Broca barrier - they had a primitive language system that could convey basic information and representations. In his tool-vine he had tied a sharpened piece of flint, which possessed a wicked edge that made short work of animal hide, and in his hands he wielded a stick with a menacing-looking pointy bit at the end: the first iteration of the spear, a weapon that would dominate the battlefields of Earth for thousands of years to come. Thag was, if he might say so himself, the quintessential working-class Paleolithic man.
